# ProjectEuler100
My (mostly commented) solutions to Project Euler's first 100 problems. Its a work in progress!

If you found this repo through searching the internet for solutions to any of the first 100 Project Euler solutions, please be aware that looking at these solutions can ruin the problem-solving process. That is the point of these problems!! Try them first. Sit on them for a couple days. Do them for your own learning, not just to get them done. 
After that, if you still can't figure it out, feel free to use my solutions. :)
